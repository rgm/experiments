# Re-frame template with figwheel.main

Starting point for a re-frame/figwheel project using tools.deps. 

Bootstrapping:
  - `brew install clojure yarn`

Running figwheel:
  - `make repl`
  - wait for repl to start
  -`(go)` will start nrepl and figwheel
  - if figwheel doesn't open a browser page itself, head to http://localhost:9500
    (or http://localhost:9500/devcards.html for the devcards UI)

(see https://figwheel.org/docs/vim.html for nrepl/piggieback tips)
