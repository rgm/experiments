;; equivalent to filtering with the set of a column's distinct values: you
;; get all of the rows. This is Excel's behaviour. It's implemented as such
;; in `filter-rows` by special-casing an empty #{} to not filter at all.
;;
;; But there *is* a useful distinction in the filtering UI: being able to
;; filter-none, *then* add one filter lets you isolate a value's rows with two
;; clicks. Being able to filter-all then remove one filter lets you hide a
;; value's rows with two clicks. Otherwise, one or the other would require
;; (count distinct-vals) - 1 clicks.
