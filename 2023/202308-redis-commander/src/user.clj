  "Events are records of effects that have happened in the system, for

   (eg. the audit log on a project).

   The only kind of event that can lead to a system mutation is a
   `:command/issued` event. (Note the lower case and passive voice).

   - including a set of audience user-ids to let downstream

   (submitted, rejected) pairs of events. (On the front-end, we might see a
   transient (submitted, bounced) pair, signifying something didn't even make
   it into the ledger usually for authz reasons).

   They flow into the ledger, where the fact of a command is quickly persisted
   as an event. A command/submitted event wrapping the command flows into the
   commander, where it's acted on, and will lead to either an accepted event or
   a rejected event (plus some optional other side events that happened. Note
   that the commander issuing a command in response is also a kind of side
   event :mindblown:).

   Commands are named with all-caps imperative voice, like :DO-A-THING!"
