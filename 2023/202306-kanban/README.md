# Opinionated Kanban

- Keep in a canonical text file
- UI has physical limits: can't increase the capacity of columns without redeploy, cards identical size, titles must be summaries, can't make things a junk drawer
- Cards show their age
- Tags are just colours, no inherent meaning
- Only three states allowed: todo, doing, done
- SPAs suck; see how far we can get with htmx
